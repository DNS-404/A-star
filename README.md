# A* Pathfinding Algorithm

A* is a computer algorithm that is widely used in pathfinding and graph traversal, which is the process of finding a path between multiple points, called "nodes".<br>
Peter Hart, Nils Nilsson and Bertram Raphael of Stanford Research Institute (now SRI International) first published the algorithm in 1968. It can be seen as an extension of Edsger Dijkstra's 1959 algorithm.<br>
A* achieves better performance by using heuristics to guide its search.

## A* in action!

- A different puzzle is generated every time randomly and A* algorithm finds a path through it from top left to bottom right.
